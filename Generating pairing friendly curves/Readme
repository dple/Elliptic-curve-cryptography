This is Readme file for the program that generates a paring-friendly elliptic curve. It will explain Input, Output of the program and also how the program works.

The program implement three methods to generate a pairing-friendly ellitptic curve: 

1) MNT curves
2) Brezing and Weng curves
3) Cocks-Pinch 

Essentially, these methods perform the two following steps:

1. Fix k and compute integers t, r, p such that there exists an elliptic curve E/GF(p) that has the trace of the Frobenius t, a subgroup of points of prime order r, and the embedding degree k. 
- This step is implemented in Magma.

2. Use the Complex Multiplication (CM) method to find the equation of the curve E/GF(p). 
- We implemented this step by C language.

Input: 
=================

This program provides an interactive input. User will be required to choose:

1. a method to generate a pairing-friendly elliptic curves; 
2. a size (in bits) of finite field GF(p); 
3. an embedding degree k.


Output:
=================

1. A base finite field GF(p), and an extension finite field GF(p^k);
2. An elliptic curve E/GF(p) of Weierstrass form: y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B; 
3. A generator P of order r.



How to run:
=========================

Start Magma, then:

> load "main.m";



Notes on Input/Output:
==========================

1. The minimum security level recommended by NIST is 80-bits, thus the size of p should be at least 160 bits.

2. The curve will be outputted on the screen and in a file "curve_output.txt"
	
3. For example, with the input is:  
- The method to generate is Cocks-Pinch.
- The size of p is 180.
- The embedding degree: k = 8.

Here is an output file for these parameters:

This program generates a pairing-friendly elliptic curve, which haves: 

- the embedding degree k = 8

- the bits number of p = 204 
- the order of the largest subgroup of points r:= 321973976242834999086687569 
- the bits number of r = 89 
- the Frobenius trace t = 47801228629206045833619282
